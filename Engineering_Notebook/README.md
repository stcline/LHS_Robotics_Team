Documenting work in an Engineering Notebook is a widely used engineering and design industry practice. This practice can help students develop life skills that they may use in their academic and professional future. By following the Engineering Design Process and documenting that process in an Engineering Notebook, students practice project management, time management, brainstorming, effective interpersonal collaboration, and written communication skills.

These pages are for your team to use to make your engineering notebook as complete as possible.  It is a very important criteria for every competition.  Any LHS team who wishes to compete will need to have a complete notebook.
